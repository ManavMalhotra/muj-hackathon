          </h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            Our platform is designed to make heart health monitoring smarter, faster, and more accessible. Using an
            IoT-based monitoring system, patients can record ECG and pulse data anytime, anywhere. The data is sent to a
            live dashboard for doctors and patients, allowing timely interventions.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            With AI-powered analysis, our system predicts potential heart risks based on vitals and medical history,
            empowering both doctors and patients to act proactively. The Smart Health Card stores a complete medical
            history from birth, making healthcare connected, transparent, and personalized.
